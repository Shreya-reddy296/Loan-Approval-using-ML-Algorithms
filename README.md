# Loan-Approval-using-ML-Algorithms

This project is to predict whether a particular person can get a loan.

I used four different ML Algorithms to train the model.
Four different ML Algorithms- Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine

Developed an interface also to show whether the person is loan approved or rejected.
Used pickle module and Flask framework to develop an interface
Used HTML for frontend purpose.
